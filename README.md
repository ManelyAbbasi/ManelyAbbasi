ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Manely!
<p>
:computer: I'm a <strong>Software Engineering and Management student</strong> in a <strong>Bachelor's program jointly offered by Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg</strong>. I'm originally from <strong>Iran</strong> and now live in <strong>Sweden</strong>, where I draw inspiration from various environments and experiences to shape my work and creativity.

:brain: I enjoy <strong>taking on challenges and solving problems</strong>, turning complex ideas into clear, working code. Whether it's building projects, working with others, or learning new tech, I'm always excited to grow and contribute.
